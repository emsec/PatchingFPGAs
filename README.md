This repository contains case studies and scripts for our research publication about senseful FPGA bitstream modifications.
The scripts work in cooperation with RapidWright, the scripting framework for Xilinx FPGAs.
Also, it has dependencies to the ProjectXray database for actual bitstream fiddling.
The scripts are written in Python and Tcl whilst the FPGA designs are written in SystemVerilog, like OpenTitan, the base for the case studies is written in.

This repository is work in progress.
